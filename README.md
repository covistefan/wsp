# wsp

To install WSP:

1) Create folder (eg. 'wsp') directly below your web-entrypoint (eg. 'www' or 'httpdocs')
2) Connect the repository to this folder
3) Install via git - Only the 7.0 branch supports git and will be developed in future, so please select it as update source
4) Run YOUR-WEBSITE.TLD/YOUR-FOLDER-NAME/wspsetup.php to go through the installation process
